## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Power BI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/End-to-End-Sports-Data-Analytics-Project.git
cd End-to-End-Sports-Data-Analytics-Project
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

## Data Collection

Web scraping is performed to collect T20 World Cup cricket data from the ESPN Cricinfo website. The `web_scraping.py` script contains the code for this step.

## Data Preprocessing

The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed using the `data_preprocessing.py` script. This step involves handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new features.

## Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using Pandas and visualization libraries. The `data_analysis.py` script contains the analysis code.

## Visualization

Power BI is used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the analyzed data effectively.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into various aspects of T20 World Cup cricket, such as player performance, team statistics, and match outcomes.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, from data collection to visualization. It showcases the power of combining web scraping, Python, and Power BI for sports data analysis.

## Future Work

- Extend the analysis to other cricket formats and tournaments.
- Automate data scraping and updating processes.
- Integrate additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
